jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.)

Form gathers input from the user.

Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.

Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.

Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline.
