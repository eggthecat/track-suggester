<!-- Your project will be reviewed on the following objectives:
All previous standards (last week's objectives) are in place (see below).

Site uses branching to return the result.

jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.)

Form gathers input from the user.

Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.

Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.

Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline.

Project demonstrates understanding of concepts covered this week. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology. -->
